### Use the following commands

#### Ensure your system has the necessary tools and libraries for the 'amass' project

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential golang git

(Golang required because Amass is written in Go.)



#### Set up the GO environment

mkdir -p ~/go/bin
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

(If you wan to make them persistent, add these lines to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file)



#### Download Amass Version 3.19.2

-Clone the specific release of Amass from its GitHub repository:

git clone https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass.git
cd amass
git checkout v3.19.2

go build -v ./cmd/amass

sudo mv amass /usr/local/bin/


#### Verify the installation

amass -version

or you can simply use

amass



#### optional setting


If the Go binaries must be accessible globally (if you didnâ€™t move the binary to /usr/local/bin), ensure the ~/go/bin directory is added to your PATH:

export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin

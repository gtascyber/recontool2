# Project Title

"Recontool2"

## Geting Started

### Short Description

This tool addresses the first step of the cyberattack cycle, known as "Reconnaissance." 
Orchestrates and leverages open-source techniques and tools to gather information, starting with a domain name, uncovering related subdomains, 
identifying their corresponding IP addresses, and finally scanning for open ports to reveal running services. 

### Environment of Development and Operation

This tool has been developed in Linux OS, "Ubuntu version 22.04.4 LTS."
We used BASH shell scripting language ("GNU bash, version 5.1.16") and Python ("Python 3.10.12") programming language.
We also used the “Cypher query Language” of Neo4j GDBMS, the “Neo4j Browser” and the “Neo4j Server” on which runs the DBMS is version 5.21.0.

### Dependencies
For the implementation of this project we orchestrated a variety of carefully chosen open-source tools and libraries. 

#### Tools
- Python3 ver. 3.10.12
- Amass v. 3.19.2
- Nmap 

#### Python modules (Part of Python's Standard Library)
sys
socket
re
subprocess
os
ipaddress
random
datetime (from datetime)
time
threading
select
csv
xml.etree.ElementTree


#### Libraries
- requests
- validators
- tldextract
- pandas
- py2neo


### Installing
The tool has been tested and validated in a few versions of the abovementioned distro Linux OS. 
It will be tested as soon as possible in more platforms but till then...... it's up to you.

First you have to install the necessary "building blocks"
- Install 'nmap' (on ubuntu) using the instruction of nmap_install.txt
- install 'amass' using the instructions of amass_install.txt

# Project Title

"Recontool2"

## Geting Started

### Short Description

This tool addresses the first step of the cyberattack cycle, known as "Reconnaissance." 
Orchestrates and leverages open-source techniques and tools to gather information, starting with a domain name, uncovering related subdomains, 
identifying their corresponding IP addresses, and finally scanning for open ports to reveal running services.

We used BASH shell scripting language (GNU bash, version 5.1.16) and Python (Python 3.10.12) programming language.
We also used the “Cypher query Language” of Neo4j GDBMS, the “Neo4j Browser” and the “Neo4j Server” on which runs the DBMS is version 5.21.0.
